# Connecting to Chateau Chainsaw Crew

## Getting your IP Address

belthesar will need your public IPv4 address in order for you to gain access to the server. To get your public IPv4 address, you can do the following:

1. Open up a web browser, and go to [google.com](https://www.google.com).  
2. In the search box, type "What is my IP" and hit enter / click Search
3. At the top of the search results, you should be presented with the following: 

![What is my IP - Google](/ccc/img/Google-WhatIsMyIp.png)

Copy the string of numbers separated by periods above "Your public IP address" and send it to belthesar via DM. In the example, this would be the string "18.41.32.292". 

## Setting up the server in Steam

Joining the server takes a little bit of extra work, but it's not too bad.

1. In Steam, go to View -> Game Servers. This will open up the server browser.

2. Click on the Favorites tab, and then click on the "+" button at the bottom to add a favorite.
![Steam Game Server Browser - Favorites](/ccc/img/steam-game-server-browser-favorites.png)
3. In the "Add server by IP" dialog, enter in the following information: `server.ccc.belthesar.com` and then click "OK"

You should now see the server in your favorites list.

## Joining the server

While this screen would lead you to believe that you can click Connect to join the server, it appears it doesn't quite work this way. The first, and every other time that you join the server, you'll need to connect with the following steps:

1. Open The Forest.
2. Once the game has launched, and you're at the main menu, alt-tab out of the game.
3. In Steam, go to View -> Game Servers. This will open up the server browser.
4. Click on the Favorites tab. You should see the server you added earlier.
5. Right click on the server, and select "View Server Info"

> Note: The IP address in the screen shot will be different than what you see above. This is normal.
6. In the "Server Info" dialog, click "Join Game"
7. Go back to The Forest. In a few moments, you should see a request to join the game lobby. Click that, and you'll be in the game!

## Notes
If you're joining for the first time, please consider migrating your save files from the Peer to Peer server to the Dedicated server. Instructions on how to do this can be found [here](/ccc/migrating_save_files.md).
